# pwnboard
The pwnboard is a tool used for RIT redteam engagements and competitions. It allows Redteam to
easily see which machines they have access to and which machines they have lost beacons on.

This is a modified version of nullmonk/pwnboard, which is a modified version of ztgrace/pwnboard.

This modified version exists to modernize nullmonk's fork since some things have changed. Documentation written by nullmonk/ztgrace.

## Running the pwnboard

For RIT Redteam engagements, the pwnboard is deployed with RedTeamDeploy. For custom deployments, see [Pwnboard Setup](./doc/setup.md).

## Watching the pwnboard

To watch all of your lovely beacons flowing in, simply navigate to the pwnboard in a webbrowser.
